### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Open Source enthusiast. I've been actively involved in Open Source from the begining of 2014, when I started contributing to various Open Source projects during my Master Studies. Since then, I have been actively involved with the [MapStruct](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct) project where I am the project lead. I created and launched the [MapStruct IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct-idea). 
I like to tinker with and explore different Open Source projects, this helps me learn new things and allows me to contribute back to the community.

I am currently employed by [Flowable](https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine).

Organization I contribute to include:

* [MapStruct](https://github.com/mapstruct)
* [Flowable](https://github.com/flowable) - I am employed by Flowable

Projects I contribute to:

* [AssertJ Core](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core)
* [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)
* [JUnit Pioneer](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer)
* [JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)
